## About Me

I’m a Software Testing Engineer with a solid frontend development background and growing backend fundamentals. I work at the intersection of **quality and development**, applying engineering principles to both testing and code.

My current focus is split deliberately: **delivering reliable test coverage today** while **continuously strengthening my development skills** to become a more well-rounded engineer.

<br/>

## Key Highlights

- 🏦 **Banking Domain Experience**  
  Worked on banking-related applications where defects have real financial impact. This required precise test cases, careful regression testing, and close coordination with developers to avoid breaking critical user flows.

- 🧪 **Quality Engineering Mindset**  
  I don’t rely on happy-path testing. I actively look for failure points by designing edge cases, negative scenarios, and validations that reflect how real users and systems actually break.

- 💻 **Developer Perspective**  
  Frontend development experience and active backend fundamentals study to better understand system internals and design decisions.

- 🔁 **Automation-Driven**  
  Practical experience building and maintaining automated tests for APIs and application logic.

## Technical Expertise

### Testing & Quality

- **Manual Testing**: Test case design, exploratory testing, regression testing
- **API Testing**: REST APIs, request/response validation, error handling (Postman)
- **Automation**: Jest, Supertest, Playwright, Katalon
- **Concepts**: SDLC, STLC, defect lifecycle, boundary & negative testing

### Development

- **Languages**: JavaScript (ES6+), TypeScript
- **Frontend**: React.js, HTML5, CSS3, Tailwind CSS, Material UI (MUI)
- **Backend (foundations & in progress)**:
  - Node.js
  - Express.js
  - HTTP & REST principles
  - Basic API design concepts
  - Request lifecycle & data validation

### Tools & Workflow

- **Version Control**: Git, GitHub
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions / GitLab CI (automated test execution)
- **Agile**: Scrum, sprint-based development, cross-functional collaboration
- **Tooling**: VS Code, Postman, Katalon

<br/>

## Current Focus

- Balancing **test automation** and **development practice** intentionally
- Improving API test coverage and CI pipeline integration
- Studying **backend fundamentals** to strengthen system-level understanding
- Writing cleaner, more maintainable code — both in tests and application logic
